In the realm of credit risk analysis, the project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default based on various borrower attributes. This is a crucial task in the finance industry as it helps in making informed lending decisions, thereby reducing the risk of bad debts. The tutorial covers a range of machine learning techniques, starting with basic single-based classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. These methods provide a solid foundation for understanding how different algorithms approach the problem of credit risk prediction.

Additionally, the tutorial delves into more advanced modeling using neural networks with Keras, a high-level neural networks API. Keras, being user-friendly and modular, makes it easy to construct and experiment with different neural network architectures. In these notebooks, you will learn how to design and train neural networks for credit risk prediction, which involves dealing with nuances specific to financial data and understanding how neural networks can capture complex patterns in the data.

## Main Purposes of this Repository:

1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover complex patterns and trends in the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Prepare the data for modeling by handling various preprocessing tasks.
3. **Model Deployment and Comparison:** Implement and compare a variety of machine learning models.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization:** Optimize the models for better performance.
