# Credit-Risk-German-Credit-Data

This notebook presents the essential steps when building a classification algorithm. I have decided to use the popular German Credit Dataset provided by the UCI machine learning repository.

Main purpuses of this project:

1) Perform exploratory data analysis to find patterns in the data
2) Apply the necessary pre processing steps to ensure model completeness and robustness
3) Deploy different classifiers and tune the single best one
